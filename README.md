  - Type `WSL: Connect To WSL`
- To verify youâ€™re now using Ubuntu in VS Code, open a terminal in VS Code
  - You should see this in the terminal
  
    `user@hostname:~$`
- Now that you're in the Ubuntu WSL environment, you can install GnuCOBOL:
  - run the following commands in the terminal:
  - `sudo apt update`
  - `sudo apt install gnucobol`
- After installing GnuCOBOL, you now compile the COBOL program using:
  - `cobc -x players.cbl`
- you will get a new executable file called `players`
- use the following command to run the executable `players`
  - `./players`
